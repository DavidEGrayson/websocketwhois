I am attempting to classify all the different protocols used by whois servers
and define them here.  This document will also be implemented in code in various
places.  The whois_server_id program will use the information here to identify
which protocol a given sever uses.  The production server will use this information
to make queries to the server and interpet their results.

ootr:
  Examples: cwhois.cnnic.cn

  Responds with 1-liners "Out of this registry..." for question mark query.

  Available domains:
    "no matching record" if domain does not exist.

  Taken domains:
    line starts with "Domain name: " (e.g. google.xn--fiqz9s | nc cwhois.cnnic.cn)
    "reserved domain" for sometimes (e.g. a.xn--fiqs8s | cwhois.cnnic.cn)
    "the domain you requested is in the reserved list" (e.g. china.xn--fiqs8s | cwhois.cnnic.cn)

		Sample output:  echo -e "google.xn--fiqz9s\r\n" | nc cwhois.cnnic.cn 43
		  Domain Name: google.中国
