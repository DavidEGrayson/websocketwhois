.COM, .NET, .EDU: All in the same Whois Server Version 2.0!
  whois.crsnic.net
  Last line of useful output is prefixed with ">>>".

  `whois -H`
    exists: prefix "Domain Name:" (line 8 or later if there is spam)
  
    If there is spam, it probably won't say "No match for " so we cannot
    use that.  Just look at `whois -H google.com` and imageine if the domain
	  name didn't exist.
	
  `echo SUM domain example.com | nc whois.crsnic.net 43`
    exists: see the domain name in all caps on its own line in the list
      starting on line 8

  Can grab all domain names starting with a certain string.
    `echo SUM PA domain graysonfamily | nc whois.crsnic.net 43`
	  Limited to 50 records: "Aborting search 50 records found ....."
    Could be used for awesome caching and reducing queries!
    Return .NET and .COM results.

.INFO
  whois.afilias.info.    ? query returns error message nothing
  http://info.info/index.php?q=faq/7
	`whois -H`
    exists: prefix "Doman Name:" (line 3)
    not exists: entire output "NOT FOUND"

  `echo domain SUM degrees.info | nc whois.afilias.info 43`
    exists: "Domain Name:$DOMAIN"

  `echo domain SUM for_.info | nc whois.afilias.info 43`
    Gets all domains that match given thing plus one letter.
  
	`whois for%.info` or
	`echo domain SUM for%.info | nc whois.afilias.info 43`
	  Gets all domains matching that pattern.  % is only allowed right before .info.
		Query is limited to 50 results; if it has 50 results we should just
		assume that results are missing but there is no explicit message.
    Entire output is "NOT FOUND" if nothing was found.
